->Project Goal:- The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict the CSAT scores based on customer interactions and feedback. By doing so, we aim to provide e-commerce businesses with a powerful tool to monitor and enhance customer satisfaction in real-time, thereby improving service quality and fostering customer loyalty.

->Specific Objectives:-

*Data Preparation:-Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for training a deep learning model.

*Feature Engineering:-Identify and engineer features from the dataset that are most predictive of CSAT scores.

*Model Development:-Design and train a deep learning ANN model to predict CSAT scores.

*Evaluation:-Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validate its predictive accuracy.

*Insight Generation:-Analyze the model's predictions to identify trends, patterns, and areas for service improvement.

*Local Deployment:-Deploy the model in your local system and setting to provide ongoing predictions and insights into customer satisfaction. This section is to be covered during your VideoÂ Presentation.
